                    <p>Yash Sharma || s3899365@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
                    <p style="text-align:center">Greetings, thank you for taking the time to visit My Profile.</p> 
                       <p style="text-align:center">My name is Yash Sharma, I'm an Indian who was born and raised in Australia. I completed my year 12 diploma in 2020 and enrolled in Royal Melbourne Institution of Technology (RMIT) in 2021 aiming to complete a bachelor's degree in Business: Information System, however my course got discontinued in the first year although I could've continued my degree in information system, I didn't feel confident in completing my course without the accreditation it once provided, hence why I decided to pursue a degree in Information Technology. This bachelor's degree in Information Technology will allow me to explore a variety of jobs that relate to many business aspects like business analyst or more programming invested like software engineer. This opportunity was worth taking especially given my interest in this degree as-well as the job growth.</p>
                        <p style="text-align:center"></pstyle>I speak 4 languages that range from fluent Hindi & Urdu, moderate Arabic & subpar French, I love learning new cultures and understanding other religions, and in the future, want to learn many more languages. One interesting fact about me would be I've probably watched over 250+ Anime/ Anime movie which range from Action and Adventure to Issekai and Shonen(so if you need anime recommendations let me know!!). I don't really have a bunch of hobbies besides going to the gym & reading, I consider myself as an introvert and don't really like going out. I'm somewhat of an “Sports Bet Connoisseur” (semi gambler) therefore my favourite team is dictated on how well their performance is, although I do go for Manchester City in football and Golden State Warriors in Basketball.</p>
                        <h1 style="text-align:center">Interest in IT</h1>
                        <h2 class="1">What is your interest in IT?</h2>
                        <p>Information Technology (IT) is the use of any computers, storage, networking and other physical devices, infrastructure, and processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data. To be honest my love for technology runs deep ever since I watched I Robot a utopian film that turns into a dystopia as it explores the shift in power between humans and robots, showing even though what we have created was to better mankind can eventually leave to destruction. This film was the first pure taste of AI technology and robotics for me after this I started exploring my interests even further learnt about cyber-security and cloud computing which I want to eventually pursue a career in. Cyber-Security interests me mainly because of Mr. Robot where the main character Elliot is a cyber-security engineer whose job is to identify threats and any vulnerability a firm might face, seeing Elliot flawlessly tackle viruses while being a "vigilant hacker" gave information technology a very heroic aspect and after watching much animes' fed my hero complex. This other side of IT that interests me is cloud computing mainly because of its rapid job growth over the ten years and salary.</p>

                        <h2 class="2">When did your interest in IT start?/ Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h2>

                        <p> There were many interest that sparked my love for IT, however there were few more then some that really sparked it:</p>

                            <h2>Anime</h2>
                            <h3>Stiens; Gate</h3>
                            <p>This anime is by far one of my favourite anime! Steins; Gate is about a group of friends who create a machine capable of sending messages across time & space that causes ripples in past and present. This anime really caught my eye mainly because of the accuracy it showed in programming, hacking and mechanical engineering however the story it's self-showed great detail and insight on how powerful technology can be and after finishing the anime I knew I wanted to pursue a degree in Information Technology/Computer Science.</p>

                            <h2>Idols</h2>
                            <h3>Steve Wozniak</h3>
                            <p>Steve Gary Wozniak the true brain behind the Apple 1 and Apple 2 computers and in my opinion the real founder of Apple. I grew up loving Apple products due to its simplicity yet powerful technology, I also was a big fan of Steve Job however reading more into Apples history realising Steve Jobs was more the business side of Apple, although very important to make the business successful, it was Steve Wozniak the engineer and computer programmer who made and designed the products that were the foundation of the trillion-dollar company we know today.</p>

                            <h2 class="4">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
                            <p>To be completely honest, I'm still figuring that out I don't want to disclose my blueprint however I want to obtain a great sense and understanding in programming, UX/UI, cloud computing as-well as cyber-security, however I want to also want to make many friends and collages doing this course given many of us would have similar interests making working together very effecting and efficient.</p>
                            <h1 style="text-align:center">Ideal Job</h1>
                            <h3 class="1">Cloud Engineer</h3>
                            <img src= "file:///Users/yashsharma/Desktop/Yash%20Sharma%20/2022/Intro%20to%20Info%20Technology/Assignment%201/Website%20/Images%20/AWS%20Cloud%20Engineering%20Middletree.jpg"

                            height="500" />
                            <p>Cloud Engineer assess a firms technology infrastructure and explores/ studies potential option of moving firms data/information to the cloud. Cloud Engineers job is to ensure and oversee the process of moving to the cloud. This job interest me mainly for the salary, cloud engineer is often in demand given everything is becoming more web based especially in relation to the metaverse, crypto-currency, cashless payments & faster broadband.</p>
                            <p>Qualification for this job, is a degree in computer science or information technology, must have a full understanding in networking, programming like python, C++, java etc. Potentially looking into a masters degree however it isn't necessary if you gain enough industry experiences in IT/computer science.</p>
                            <p>Currently I don't have the current qualification to become a cloud engineer, given that I'm in my first year of Information Technology, however I do have a year 12 diploma, which isn't relevant at all.</p>
                            <h2>Game Plan</h2>
                            <p>My plan is something I've greatly thought of given I'm an adult now and can't rely of my parent or my school to hold my hand every step forward. My Bachelor of Information Technology degree is a 3-year degree in which, I wish to gain the knowledge and confidence in my programming and web language skills. I wish to enrol in an AWS certification in my 2nd year once I've gained the fundamentals, this will look good on my resume given I'll have education from another respected institution. In year 3 I wish to change my fixed year to a flexible year and aim to gain an internship while studying so when I graduate, I will have gained a decent amount of industry experience.</p>

                            <h3 class="1">Myers Briggs Test</h3>
                            <img src="file:///Users/yashsharma/Desktop/Yash%20Sharma%20/2022/Intro%20to%20Info%20Technology/Assignment%201/Website%20/Images%20/Myers%20briggs.jpg"

                            <img src="file:///Users/yashsharma/Desktop/Yash%20Sharma%20/2022/Intro%20to%20Info%20Technology/Assignment%201/Website%20/Images%20/Learning%20Style%20Test.jpg"

                            <h3 class="3">Test of my choice</h3>
                            <img src="file:///Users/yashsharma/Desktop/Yash%20Sharma%20/2022/Intro%20to%20Info%20Technology/Assignment%201/Website%20/Images%20/Test%20of%20my%20choice%20(What%20Anime%20Best%20Boy%20Are%20You%3F).jpg"
                            width="500"
                            height="500" />
                            <h4 class="4">What do these results mean to you?</h4>
                            <p>As test are conducted to analyse and determine whether an entity has appropriately learned a subject or to determine where in academics or life they are currently. These test which I conducted mean nothing to me solely because they don't hold any scientific merit therefore in my opinion don't determine anything I don't know already or wish to know. 'Myers Briggs' is known to be not very reliable as entities that conduct the test the 2nd time don't receive the same results as they did the first time therefore being not valid. 'Learning Style' in my opinion is very subjective on a majority pole as these types of tests, group entities in a type of learning style that may or may not work and restrict them to believe and follow a style they might not feel comfortable using especially in different subjects. 'Buzz Feed; What anime best boy are you?' was conducted based just on my enjoyment and to be honest is probably the only test that matters to me as it allows me to show my interest and hobbies through the character, I was declared I am. Test of our choice will allow entities to express themselves and help in understanding the entitles deeply as it show evidence in what they like and what their interest are.</p>
                            <h3 class="5">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
                            <p>'Myers Briggs' is a personality test that is conducted to help people understand the personality differences within a general population. The results I received were INTJ-A which means I'm 'Innovative, Independent, Strategic, Logical, Reversed & Insightful'. According to statistics INTJ-A personality types are rare with only 1-4% of the population being this personality type. Although it's good to be different and unique, within group work it can be seen as a negative as some group members may have a superior complex in which they might constantly gloat their results above other group members who received 'common' personalities, breaking and damaging group chemistry making completing task difficult and unobtainable. 'Learning Style' can be deemed beneficial especially if some group members have similar styles of learning as it can help learning content much more effective given you will gain assistance however difference in learning style could cause a drift in group contribution as some members might be slower absorbing content compared to other members. 'Anime Test' will help build chemistry only if other members have same interest as you because it will reduce the level of burring out as taking breaks talking about interest is proven to boost efficiency greatly.</p>
                            <h3 class="6">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
                            <p>In my opinion these tests shouldn't be taking to account besides the 'test of your choice' as when forming a group, it is important to talk to a person and learn/understand their reasoning in doing the current subject as well as what their interest are as this is the best possible way to build chemistry and making group tasks enjoyable.</p>
                            <h1 style="text-align:center">Project Idea: Automated Trading Platform (Software)</h1>
                            <h2>Overview</h2>
                            <p>An automated trading system is a subset of algorithm trading, that is utilised by a computer program which allows traders to create buy and sell orders on multiple platforms automatically as it submits orders to the market centre or exchange (Wikipedia). The success of day-traders is 1%, 99% of day-traders fail because of emotions, greed, and bad judgement. This automated trading aims to eliminate these errors by using a software which can mirror, copy, and paste trades on many platforms increasing the daily profits potentially by 10 times if done correctly. This system should be recommended to all traders who have large balances as it reduces the risks of failure.</p>
                            <h3>Motivation</h3>
                            <p>I've noticed quite a lot by being a trader myself and seeing other traders who have failed multiple times and given up however I haven't given up even though I've failed many times I believe this software is the key to eliminate human error like;</p>
                            <h3>Minimizing emotion</h3>
                            <p>As trades are processed when traders see profits we often wait till the very last second to close the trade so we can receive the most value out of trades, however high volatile trades are often hard to read as most of the time they are very quick and hard to pin point a pattern therefore with an automated trading software it will allow the program to close the trade once it finds a pattern hence minimising human emotion.</p>
                            <h3>Achieving Consistency</h3>
                            <p>Programs like these allows trades to remain in profits if done correctly, because you could program the software to close traders once it's reached 50 or 100 pips (percentage in point) potentially increasing average profits.</p>
                            <p>There are many more benefits of this program/software and is my main motivation in pursuing it as I understand the benefits and believe it will help increase day-traders success rates.</p>
                            <h1>Description</h1>
                            <p>Automated trading system is also known as mechanical trading system which is done by creating an algorithmic trade, automated trading, or system trading. This allows brokers and traders to set principles and rules when trading on the exchange. 70% to 80% of trades on the U.S. stock exchange comes from automatic trading systems (Chatterjee, 2022).  The name of my automated trading platform is 'OTF' no real meaning behind it however it will be a user-friendly software that is installed on a traders electronic device with a web base option. It will run off a subscription base which is capped by how many automated trades they can make in a day.</p>
                            <p>The features OTF will have will be unlike the outdated software's trades and brokers use now as it will;</p>
                            <h3>Review Market Data</h3>
                            <p>Certain platforms only have some access to market data, however OTF will aim to have market data provided when agreeing to make trades as it's important to know how the currency or stocks is doing.</p>
                            <h3>Web Delivered Platform</h3>
                            <p>Many automated software's only provide user with a software that they must install onto a computer, however the problem with this is majority of software programs are only compatible with installed trading platforms. OTF aims to minimise that especially in current times trades are often done on web-based platforms as they are efficient and effective given servers can be real time updated due to cloud computing, hence OTF automated platform will provide brokers and traders with web-based extension.</p>
                            <h3>Latency</h3>
                            <p>Latency is an often occurrence in many trading platforms due to many factors like time-zones and human errors with this program my aim is to also program the software to take into consideration where this system is being used and adapt to its environment so a stable foundation can be made making usability efficient and effective.</p>
                            <h3>Easy to use</h3>
                            <p>Many algorithmic trading platforms usually require actual trading experiences however OTF aims to offer easier user experience by being direct as-well as providing video tutorials on how to use the program, it will also provide a trial base usage where traders can provide feedback on what should be done to make program even more friendly.</p>
                            <h3>Protect against market crashers</h3>
                            <p>Many automated programs don't notify traders the health of the market nor does it detect it as systems tend to be too specific on individual trades completely open the system to market crash vulnerability hence OTF will provide premium subscription option that allow the system to focus on the market as a whole and not just individual trade.</p>
                            <p>Plenty of more features will be embedded into the system as time go on however my intention are not only to provide the best service, I would also would want to make OTF look appealing by making a modern system which is easy on the eyes by providing users to personally customise the system how they please with up to 5 colours to pick from in terms of the systems back (black, white, blue, red and green) as-well as design how they would like to place what feature they want to for example moving the chart/graph to the left side of the interface instead of the default of the right side having a section of traders watchlist making them easy to monitor.</p>
                            <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
                            <p>Given my product is service based I wouldn't need many tools as-well as technology in order to provide the best performance of this system, however I will need high performing computer preferable a MacBook pro 2021 model with the M1 chip as during testing phase I'll need to monitor multiple trades and integrated systems other resources I'll need is the use of a trading account preferable demo given many errors can still occur in the first phase of testing and Vscode as I'd need to write code for the software in order for it work preferable C++. Otherwise OTF wouldn't need any physically tool and technologies to make the system run.</p>
                            <h1>Skills Required</h1>
                            <p>In order to understand and grasp the power OTF can truly have on people's lives you will need to have a great understanding in trading and financial market given this platform is created to assist traders and stockbrokers, you would also need to also have an understanding in algebra, probability theory, linear algebra and regression as-well as statistics and calculus. After understanding the foundation other skills would be knowing how to write code especially in C++ given many automated platforms are written in this language. Hence these are the skills needed in order to create a functional automated trading platform that will allow traders to trade, sell and buy efficiently.</p>
                            <h1>Outcome</h1>
                            <p>Overall, I want to create a system even a person with little knowledge of trading can use, so financially they are able to profit. By doing this it will allow many people to be potentially financial free and not be burden by mortgages and loans, I believe it is apparel to teach people finance so that they can use these programs to create better living standards for not only them but other. I believe OTF can do that if given the effort and energy in creating a program as it will be tailored to individual users and preferences and not a majority preferences as that's the main problem of many other automated systems.</p>
